#### Describe about the cleaned dataset:

**The dataset contains NYC subway station information, including line,
station name, latitude/longitude, routes(Route1-Route7), entry status,
vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance.**

**Data cleaning involved standardizing column names, selecting relevant
variables, and converting the entry variable to a logical TRUE/FALSE
format. The cleaned dataset has 1,868 rows and 15 columns, and with each
row representing a unique station entrance or exit.**

**But I don’t think is tidy enough, because it still have many missing
data (NA).**

``` r
distinct_stations <- cleaned_data %>% 
  distinct(station_name, line) 

n_distinct_stations <- nrow(distinct_stations)
n_distinct_stations
```

    ## [1] 465

**The number of distinct stations are 465**

``` r
ada_compliant_stations <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>%
  distinct(station_name, line)

n_ada_compliant_stations <- nrow(ada_compliant_stations)

n_ada_compliant_stations
```

    ## [1] 84

**There are 84 ADA compliant stations.**

``` r
no_vending_entrances <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(vending == "NO")

proportion_allowing_entrance <- mean(no_vending_entrances$entry)
proportion_allowing_entrance
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

**The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance is about 37.70.**

#### reform the data

``` r
reformatted_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("route"), 
               names_to = "route_number", 
               values_to = "route_name") %>%
  filter(!is.na(route_name)) 
```

#### the number of distinct stations that serve the A train

``` r
a_train_stations <- reformatted_data %>%
  filter(route_name == "A") %>%
  distinct(station_name, line)

n_a_train_stations <- nrow(a_train_stations)
n_a_train_stations
```

    ## [1] 60

**There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train**

``` r
# Filter for ADA-compliant stations that serve the A train
ada_a_train_stations <- reformatted_data %>%
  filter(route_name == "A", ada == TRUE) %>%
  distinct(station_name, line)

n_ada_a_train_stations <- nrow(ada_a_train_stations)

n_ada_a_train_stations
```

    ## [1] 17

**There are 17 stations that serve the A train are ADA compliant.**

gwynnda_trash_wheel_data <- gwynnda_trash_wheel_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(dumpster))

view(gwynnda_trash_wheel_data)

#no sports_balls and glass bottles
```

#### creat a new data sheet

If we want to make a new table i should add a “sports_ball” column in
professor_trash_wheel_data table and add “lass_bottles” “sports_balls”
in gwynnda_trash_wheel_data table.

``` r
mr_trash_wheel_data <- mr_trash_wheel_data %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year))

professor_trash_wheel_data <- professor_trash_wheel_data %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year))

gwynnda_trash_wheel_data <- gwynnda_trash_wheel_data %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year))

professor_trash_wheel_data <- professor_trash_wheel_data %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = NA)

gwynnda_trash_wheel_data <- gwynnda_trash_wheel_data %>%
  mutate(glass_bottles = NA, sports_balls = NA)

combined_trash_wheel_data <- bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel_data, professor_trash_wheel_data, gwynnda_trash_wheel_data)

view(combined_trash_wheel_data)
```

Description of the new dataset:

The combined_trash_wheel_data combines data from the three sources:
Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel, and Gwynnda Trash Wheel. The
dataset contains 1,033 rows and 14 columns. Key variables in the dataset
include weight_tons, which records the weight of trash collected in
tons, and volume_cubic_yards, representing the volume of trash collected
in cubic yards. Additionally, the dataset contains variables like
plastic_bottles (number of plastic bottles collected), cigarette_butts,
and sports_balls, though some columns such as sports_balls and
glass_bottles were missing from certain sources and have been filled
with NA values where applicable.The variables sports_balls and
glass_bottles were added to datasets that didn’t originally have them,
with missing data represented as NA.

#### The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel

``` r
total_weight_professor <- professor_trash_wheel_data %>%
  summarise(total_weight_tons = sum(weight_tons, na.rm = TRUE))

total_weight_professor
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total_weight_tons
    ##               <dbl>
    ## 1              247.

The total weight is 246.75 tons.

#### The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of 2022

``` r
total_cigarette_butts_gwynnda_june_2022 <- gwynnda_trash_wheel_data %>%
  filter(month == "June", year == "2022") %>%
  summarise(total_cigarette_butts = sum(cigarette_butts, na.rm = TRUE))

total_cigarette_butts_gwynnda_june_2022
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total_cigarette_butts
    ##                   <dbl>
    ## 1                 18120

The total number of cigarette is 18120 butts.

# Problem3

Delete the first two lines of results,csv and show all the columns name.

``` r
results <- read.csv("results.csv", skip = 2)|> 
  janitor::clean_names()
bakes <- read.csv("bakes.csv")|>
  janitor::clean_names()
bakers <- read.csv("bakers.csv")|>
  janitor::clean_names()

colnames(results)
```

    ## [1] "series"    "episode"   "baker"     "technical" "result"

``` r
colnames(bakes)
```

    ## [1] "series"         "episode"        "baker"          "signature_bake"
    ## [5] "show_stopper"

``` r
colnames(bakers)
```

    ## [1] "baker_name"       "series"           "baker_age"        "baker_occupation"
    ## [5] "hometown"

These lines of R code use the mutate() function to ensure that specific
columns in the results, bakes, and bakers datasets are converted to the
character data type and have consistent names for merging.

``` r
results <- results |> setNames(c("series", "episode", "baker", "technical", "result")) #rename the variables of results and make them consist with other two fies.

bakes <- bakes |>
  mutate(series = as.numeric(series), episode = as.numeric(episode))

results <- results |>
  mutate(series = as.numeric(series), episode = as.numeric(episode))

bakers <- bakers |>
  mutate(baker = baker_name) |>
  mutate(series = as.numeric(series))

#change to first name
bakers <- bakers |>
  mutate(baker = word(baker, 1))
```

``` r
#check for completeness and correctness across datasets (e.g. by viewing individual datasets and using anti_join
REBE <- anti_join(results, bakers, by = c("series", "baker")) |> nrow()
BERE <- anti_join(bakers, results, by = c("series", "baker")) |> nrow()
REBE
```

    ## [1] 8

``` r
BERE
```

    ## [1] 1

``` r
# we can merge the bakers and results first , because there are too many missing data in bakes file.

bakeresults <- results |>
  left_join(bakers, by = c("series", "baker"))

view(bakeresults)
```

``` r
# we will merge the bakes table with bakeresults table and make it in meaningful orders.
final_data <- bakeresults |>
  left_join(bakes, by = c("series", "episode", "baker")) |>
  select(series, episode, baker, baker_age, baker_occupation, hometown, 
         signature_bake, show_stopper, technical, result) |>
  arrange(series, episode, baker)

view(final_data)
```
